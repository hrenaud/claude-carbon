# Methodology

## Overview

Emissions are estimated from token counts using per-token factors derived from peer-reviewed research. The approach is intentionally simple: one number per model family per token direction. No real-time data, no per-request tracing.

The paper measures inference energy consumption on AWS infrastructure for a range of models, then converts to CO2e using grid-average carbon intensity.

## Formula

```
session_co2_grams = (input_tokens * input_factor + output_tokens * output_factor) / 1_000_000
```

Factors are in gCO2e per million tokens.

## Infrastructure parameters

| Parameter | Value            | Description                                      |
| --------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| PUE       | 1.14             | AWS datacenter power usage effectiveness         |
| CIF       | 0.287 kgCO2e/kWh | Carbon intensity factor (US grid average)        |
| WUE       | 0.18 L/kWh       | Water usage effectiveness (not used in CO2 calc) |

## Per-model factors (gCO2e per million tokens)

| Model family | Input | Output | Source                     |
| ------------ | ----- | ------ | -------------------------- |
| Opus         | 500   | 3000   | Extrapolated (3x Sonnet)   |
| Sonnet       | 190   | 1140   | Measured (Jegham et al.)   |
| Haiku        | 95    | 570    | Extrapolated (0.5x Sonnet) |

## Why input and output factors differ

Output tokens are ~6x more expensive than input tokens in terms of compute. During prefill (input processing), the model processes all input tokens in parallel. During decoding (output generation), each token requires a full forward pass through the model sequentially. This autoregressive step dominates energy consumption.

## Why Opus and Haiku are extrapolated

The Jegham paper measured Sonnet-class models directly. Opus and Haiku factors are estimated by scaling:

- Opus = 3x Sonnet (larger model, roughly proportional parameter count)
- Haiku = 0.5x Sonnet (smaller model, lighter compute)

These are order-of-magnitude estimates. Actual values depend on Anthropic's specific hardware configuration and batching strategies, which are not publicly available.

## Limitations

- Order of magnitude only. Do not use these numbers for regulatory reporting or lifecycle assessments.
- Inference only. Training costs, hardware manufacturing, and cooling water are not included.
- Cache read tokens excluded from reports. Only `input_tokens` and `cache_creation_input_tokens` are counted in backfill and persist-session (JSONL parsing). Cache reads (90%+ of tokens in Claude Code) consume negligible energy and are ignored.
- Status line is approximate. Claude Code does not expose `cache_read_input_tokens` separately in the statusline hook JSON, and parsing JSONL incrementally at each turn would be too slow. The live display uses `context_window.total_input_tokens` (current context size, includes cache reads, no subagents). This is not used in reports.
- Grid-average, not real-time. The CIF is a static US grid average. Actual emissions depend on Anthropic's datacenter location, energy mix, and time of day.
- No multi-region awareness. AWS runs inference in multiple regions with different grid intensities.
